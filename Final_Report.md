## 1. Introduction
This project develops machine learning models to predict beef carcass composition without invasive procedures. The models estimate bone, fat, and muscle volumes using basic measurements, achieving high accuracy through gradient boosting and data augmentation.

### Project Components
- Data collection from CT scans
- Data augmentation implementation
- Gradient boosting model development
- Performance visualization

### Objectives
1. Develop production-ready prediction models
2. Implement effective data augmentation
3. Compare model performance
4. Create clear visualizations

## 2. Data and Methods

### Data Sources
- Primary dataset: CT scan measurements
- Contains both input measurements and volume data

### Features
- Input: Basic measurements (tot_bone_*, tot_fat_*, tot_musc_*, tot_wt_*)
- Output: Volume measurements (tot_bone_vol_*, etc.)

### Data Augmentation
Initial dataset: 98 samples
Implementation:
1. Applied controlled noise injection
2. Validated distribution consistency
Final dataset: 980 samples

## 4. Results

### Bone Volume
- Sirloin:
  - Base: R² = 0.977
  - Augmented: R² = 0.996

- Round:
  - Base: R² = 0.981
  - Augmented: R² = 0.996

Analysis: Data augmentation improved already strong performance. Deeper trees (depth=5) proved effective.

### Fat Volume
- Sirloin:
  - Base: R² = 0.993
  - Augmented: R² = 0.996

- Round:
  - Base: R² = 0.988
  - Augmented: R² = 0.996

Analysis: Fat volume showed strong base performance. Augmentation provided incremental improvements.

### Muscle Volume
- Sirloin:
  - Base: R² = 0.982
  - Augmented: R² = 0.996

- Round:
  - Base: R² = 0.925
  - Augmented: R² = 0.996

Analysis: Muscle prediction showed most improvement, particularly for round cuts (7% gain).

### Key Findings
1. Consistent performance improvements
2. Weight measurements proved crucial
3. Larger dataset enabled more complex models

## Implementation Guide

1. Model Setup:
   - Load scaler.pkl
   - Load relevant model
   - Prepare input data

Example implementation:
```python
import pandas as pd
import pickle

# load components
with open("models/scaler.pkl", "rb") as f:
    scaler = pickle.load(f)

with open("models/musc_sirloin_model.pkl", "rb") as f:
    model = pickle.load(f)

# load data
data = pd.read_csv("measurements.csv")

# generate predictions
X_scaled = scaler.transform(data)
predictions = model.predict(X_scaled)
print("Predictions:", predictions)
```

Note: Include relevant plots from outputs/plots for visualization
