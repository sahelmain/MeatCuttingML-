# Beef Carcass Tissue Volume Prediction Project Summary

## Project Overview
This project develops machine learning models to predict the volumes of different tissue types (muscle, fat, and bone) across various cuts of beef carcasses using CT scan measurements. The goal is to provide accurate, non-invasive volume predictions that can aid in carcass evaluation and grading.

## Data Description
- **Source**: CT scan measurements of beef carcasses
- **Sample Size**: Full dataset of carcass measurements
- **Features**: Non-volume measurements for each tissue type (muscle, fat, bone) across different cuts
- **Target Variables**: Tissue volumes for each cut:
  - 3 tissue types (muscle, fat, bone)
  - 8 cuts (sirloin, round, loinwing, rib, plate, chuckroll, chuckclod, chuckbrisket)
  - Total of 24 different volume predictions

## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Feature selection: Used non-volume measurements as predictors
   - Data splitting: 80% training, 20% testing
   - Feature scaling: StandardScaler applied to both features and targets

2. **Model Architecture**:
   - Separate GradientBoostingRegressor for each tissue type and cut
   - Hyperparameters:
     - n_estimators: 200
     - learning_rate: 0.1
     - max_depth: 3
     - min_samples_split: 5
     - subsample: 0.8

3. **Model Organization**:
   - Models saved in organized directory structure
   - Separate scalers for features and targets
   - Easy-to-use prediction interface

## Results Summary

### Overall Performance
1. **Bone Predictions** (Best Overall):
   - Mean Error: 0.18%
   - Best Cut: Rib (0.07% mean error)
   - Most Challenging: Chuckclod (0.58% mean error)

2. **Muscle Predictions**:
   - Mean Error: 0.32%
   - Best Cut: Loinwing (0.13% mean error)
   - Most Challenging: Chuckclod (1.36% mean error)

3. **Fat Predictions**:
   - Mean Error: 0.58%
   - Best Cut: Chuckroll (0.32% mean error)
   - Most Challenging: Loinwing (0.88% mean error)

### Known Limitations and Inaccuracies

1. **Chuckclod Predictions**:
   - Higher variability across all tissue types
   - Muscle: Up to 113.21% error in extreme cases
   - Bone: Up to 46.62% error in extreme cases
   - Possible reasons:
     - Complex anatomical structure
     - Variable cutting practices
     - Limited training data for this specific cut

2. **Fat Volume Predictions**:
   - Occasional high errors in specific cuts:
     - Loinwing: Up to 23% error
     - Sirloin: Up to 29.96% error
   - More variable than muscle and bone predictions
   - May be affected by:
     - Fat distribution variability
     - Measurement challenges in CT scans

3. **Model Limitations**:
   - Assumes consistent cutting practices
   - May not generalize to significantly different carcass sizes
   - Limited to the measurement ranges in training data

## Recommendations for Improvement

1. **Data Collection**:
   - Gather more data for challenging cuts (especially chuckclod)
   - Include more diverse carcass sizes and types
   - Standardize measurement procedures

2. **Model Enhancements**:
   - Develop specialized models for challenging cuts
   - Implement ensemble methods for more robust predictions
   - Add uncertainty quantification

3. **Validation**:
   - Conduct cross-validation across different facilities
   - Compare with physical measurements
   - Test on diverse cattle breeds

## Practical Applications

1. **Quality Grading**:
   - Rapid, non-invasive assessment
   - Consistent evaluation metrics
   - Reduced labor costs

2. **Process Optimization**:
   - Better yield prediction
   - Improved cutting strategies
   - Reduced waste

3. **Research Applications**:
   - Breeding program evaluation
   - Nutrition study impacts
   - Growth pattern analysis
